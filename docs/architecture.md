# Architecture

## Overview

Remem is an AI-native semantic cache that reduces the cost and latency of LLM applications by intelligently reusing previous executions.

Unlike traditional caches that operate on exact keys, Remem determines whether previously executed work can be safely reused based on **semantic similarity** combined with **execution metadata**.

      │    (similarity ≥ 0.95)      Skip vector DB and LLM entirely
      │
      ├──► RETRIEVAL_REUSED  ──► Use cached document IDs, call LLM only
      │    (similarity ≥ 0.80)      Skip the vector DB search
      │
      └──► MISS              ──► Run the full pipeline
           (similarity < 0.80)      Store the result with client.remember()
```

Metadata filtering always runs **before** similarity computation. Stored records are first narrowed by `ReusePolicy` constraints — namespace, knowledge-base version, prompt version, and model — so similarity is only ever computed across genuinely compatible candidates. This is what allows a knowledge-base update or a model switch to invalidate stale results automatically, with no manual cache-busting.

## Core Components

### SDK / Client

The primary interface used by application code (`remem/client.py`). Responsibilities:

- Expose `check`, `remember`, `get_or_compute`, and lower-level storage operations
- Coordinate the reuse engine and storage layer
- Hide all internal implementation details behind a small, stable surface

### Reuse Engine

Located in `remem/reuse/engine.py`. Orchestrates the end-to-end decision process: it invokes the metadata matcher, then the similarity engine, and combines their outputs into a single `ReuseOutcome`. The decision process is deterministic and entirely policy-driven — the same inputs always produce the same decision.

Possible outcomes:

- **Full reuse** (`RESPONSE_REUSED`) — the cached response is returned as-is
- **Retrieval reuse** (`RETRIEVAL_REUSED`) — cached documents are reused, generation re-runs
- **No reuse** (`MISS`) — nothing usable was found

### Metadata Matcher

Located in `remem/reuse/matcher.py`. Applies `ReusePolicy` constraints to filter stored records before any similarity computation happens. Examples of what it checks:

- Same namespace
- Same knowledge-base version
- Same prompt version
- Same model

### Similarity Engine

Located in `remem/similarity/engine.py`, backed by `remem/similarity/metrics.py`. Finds semantically related requests among metadata-compatible candidates.

- **Current implementation:** exact cosine similarity search
- **Planned:** Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, HNSW indexing, hybrid retrieval — see the [Roadmap](roadmap.md)

### Storage Layer

Abstracted behind `StorageInterface` (`remem/storage/storage.py`), so the reuse engine never depends on a specific persistence mechanism.

| Implementation | File | Persistence |
|---|---|---|
| `JsonStorage` | `remem/storage/json_storage.py` | Durable — atomic file writes |
| `InMemoryStorage` | `remem/storage/memory_storage.py` | Volatile — in-process only |
| `Serializer` | `remem/storage/serializer.py` | JSON round-trip for `ExecutionRecord` |

Planned backends include SQLite, PostgreSQL, Redis, and cloud object storage.

### Observability

`remem/metrics/collector.py` accumulates telemetry throughout the process lifetime and produces an immutable `MetricsSnapshot` (`remem/metrics/snapshot.py`) on demand — hit rate, reuse breakdown, and average similarity.

## Data Models

**`ExecutionRecord`** — the unit stored in the persistence layer:

```
id           UUID
embedding    list[float]         # the query embedding
response     Any                 # LLM output (string, dict, DataFrame, ...)
references   list[str]           # document / chunk IDs from the vector DB
context      ExecutionContext    # metadata used for filtering
hit_count    int                 # number of times this record has been reused
created_at   datetime
```

**`ExecutionContext`** — metadata scoping for a request:

```
namespace       str              # e.g. "support-bot", "tenant:acme"
kb_version      str              # knowledge-base version string
prompt_version  str              # prompt template version
model           str | None       # LLM identifier, e.g. "gpt-4o"
metadata        dict[str, Any]   # custom key-value pairs
```

Full field-by-field documentation lives in the [API Reference](api.md).

## Design Principles

**Local-first.** Remem should work fully without any external infrastructure — no database, no network calls, no API keys.

**Modular.** Every subsystem (similarity, metadata filtering, storage, observability) can evolve independently behind its own interface.

**Extensible.** New storage engines, embedding providers, and reuse policies should be straightforward to add without touching the core decision logic.

**Explainable.** Every `ReuseOutcome` carries a `reason` and a `similarity_score` — reuse decisions are never a black box.

**Production-ready.** The architecture is designed to scale from a single local script to a production service, without a rewrite in between.

## Future Architecture

The longer-term direction includes:

- ANN indexes for large-scale similarity search
- Distributed, multi-process, and multi-node cache coordination
- Cloud-native storage and synchronization
- Multi-tenant deployment primitives
- A dedicated benchmarking suite
